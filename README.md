# Data Dashboard with Infusion
Tool for explorative, accessible data visualisations

## Run Example

If you'd like to see the tool run an example visualization, simple start by serving the directory.
E.G.:
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
in the root of the repo

Then take your browser to `localhost:8000`

There should already be sample data in the text area.
Use the dropdown box at the top to select line graph.
Press the "Parse" button.
A line graph in d3 should appear!
