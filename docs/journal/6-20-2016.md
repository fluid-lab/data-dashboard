Realizing one of the hardest questions will be how to make adding data to the graph easy. When clicking a field a user could intend a number of things, pending the type of graph.

If you have an x-y line graph, a user could mean:

1. Filter an axis by a certain field
2. Select all instances of a particular field
3. Select only the instances of a field which also match some other field (ie, Graph GDP values for entries where COUNTY is USA)

If you have a pie chart, a user could mean:

1. Bind a field to the "pie"
2. Add another categorical variable

This could go on...

What it means is that, the entire canvas of options for a representation must be based on which representation you're intending or else selections of data will become too convoluted (in terms of number of possibilities) for comprehension.

We'll need to change the spec some to fix this. Namely, we need to rethink the _Fields Component_ because we now want the way you select fields to be dependent on the kind of chart you are adding. 

It is this I'd like to talk about in this week's chat. I think it'll require careful consideration to figure out the extent to which the whole Representation Component can be broken up to support each different type of representation.
